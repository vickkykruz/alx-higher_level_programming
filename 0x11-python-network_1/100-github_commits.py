"""
Write a Python script that takes your GitHub credentials
(username and password) and uses the GitHub API to display your id

    => You must use Basic Authentication with a personal access token as
        password to access to your information (only read:user permission
        is needed)
    => The first argument will be your username
    => The second argument will be your password (in your case, a personal
        access token as password)
    => You must use the package requests and sys
    => You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
    => You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or
